# Industry
Production of resources on a large scale in Minecraft has many bottlenecks, and can be quite difficult to scale. It should be fun for players to produce large quantities of resources, in order to facilitate trade and surplus stock.

## Factories
Factories are series of multiblock structures that connect together to make a product. However, a factory is a construct, as nothing *needs* to be automated. If a player wants to make resources on a large scale quickly and efficiently, they will need to collectivize their industry.

## Structures
All industries have multiblock structures that will take a variable input and fuel, and will output the corresponding item. These structures are often scalable, and can be made out of varying materials.

The process of crafting an item can go through multiple structures. For example, Ore must be crushed in a Crusher structure before being processed in a Refinery. Structures may move items to & from inventories.

## Automation
While players can manually manage structures, large scale production can easily become difficult. Automation makes running complex supply chains easier & more efficient.

+ Structures emit a redstone signal, which can both indicate that a structure is on, or organize where resources are sent.
+ Structures can be set to automatically craft the previously selected recipe.
+ Transporting materials from one structure to another using rails or water tubes.
