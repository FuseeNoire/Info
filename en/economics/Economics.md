# Economics
The economy of a standard Minecraft server is very lacking. Being a single-player focused game, a player does not need to collaborate to sustain themselves and accumulate wealth. Combined with the lack of scalable production, the standard Minecraft experience is often solitary.
# Approach
When planning to have nations make functional economies, it is important to take into account both the perspective of the nation **and** the player.

A player **has to**;
1. Rely on others for resources. This encourages the player to continue to specialize production of materials they have the means to, trading their specialty for needed resources. Whether the player relies solely upon its nation's citizenry, businesses, or government is up to the economic system the residing nation is under.
2. Have incentive to participate in meeting demand. A nation entirely composed of agrarian industry will struggle if they do not focus on exports to other nations. The player should feel encouraged to profit off of deficiencies in material, to simulate a competitive market.
 
A nation **has to**; 
1. Consider their dependence on other nations. Reliance on foreign economies is expected if your economic system in both consumerist and export economies. While a closed economy would minimize foreign influence, your capacity for production would lower drastically. Ideally, a centralized nation's economy is flexible and can adapt to the world economy.
2. Convince their citizenry to work in and construct industry suited towards the national economy. Classical oriented economies may have more success with more decentralized, market economics.
